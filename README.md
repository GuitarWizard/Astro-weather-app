Early back end for an astrophotography weather forecasting application

Currently it's started with lat, long coordinates for rural Minnesota. Eventually it will be a user input.
At the moment, it reaches out to several API's to collect the location of the ISS, the local astronomical and nautical twilight start and end times (very important for astrophotography), and gets the local weather foreast from the US national weather service.
